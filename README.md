# Stock Analysis
Analysis of stock market data from 2017 and 2018

## Overview

In this analysis, the client initially desired a quick and easy way to identify two indicators of performance ("total volume" and "return") for twelve companies in the US stock market. Total volume is based on the amount of trades for a company's stock in 2017 and 2018. The return percentage reflects the stock's fluctuations (increase or decrease) for a single year.

After establishing this basic code, we refractored the code to loop through all the data at one time to enable the VBA script to run faster. This will enable to script to run faster for larger datasets (aka the entire stock market, not just twelve companies).
